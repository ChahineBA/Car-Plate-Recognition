# Car Plate Recognition System 🚗🔍

Welcome to our Car Plate Recognition System repository! 

This repository contains the source code for a robust and efficient car plate recognition system implemented using YOLOv5, PyTorch, OpenCV, and TensorFlow. Our system is designed to accurately detect and recognize license plates from images or video streams in real-time.

## Key Features
- Utilizes YOLOv5 implemented with PyTorch for efficient vehicle detection.
- Employs advanced image processing techniques in OpenCV for license plate extraction.
- Utilizes TensorFlow-powered neural networks for precise character and number recognition on license plates.
- Offers high scalability and can be deployed across various platforms, including embedded systems, edge devices, or cloud servers.
- Provides a reliable solution for automating vehicle identification in traffic management, law enforcement, or access control applications.
